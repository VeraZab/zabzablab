# Texture pitch page: plan

## How many designs to show

- **Recommendation: 4–6 designs** on the pitch page.
- Enough to show range and build trust; not so many that it feels like a catalog.
- Message: “Curated base options that work for any project,” not “browse everything.”
- If you have more than 6, either:
  - Show 4–6 “hero” textures and add “See more on Spoonflower” for the rest, or
  - Group by sub-style (e.g. linen, canvas, burlap) and show 1–2 per group.

## One page vs separate (faux fabric / faux stone / faux limewash)

### Current: one page with three sections

- **One URL**, e.g. `/designs/texture-foundations`.
- Sections: **Faux fabric** → **Faux stone** → **Faux limewash**. Same problem (versatile, customizable base), same solution (your textures + custom form).
- 4–6 designs per category; one "Customize your base" CTA at the end for all three.

### If you later want separate pages per category

- Use if you have **many designs per category** (e.g. 8+ each) and want distinct SEO landing pages:
  - `/designs/faux-fabric-textures`
  - `/designs/faux-stone`
  - `/designs/faux-limewash`
- Add a small hub: “Texture foundations” that links to all three.
- Pros: Can rank for “faux fabric wallpaper for designers,” “faux stone wallpaper,” etc. separately.
- Cons: More pages to maintain; message is repeated.

**Recommendation:** Start with **one page** focused on **faux fabric** as the solution. Add stone/limewash as sections on that page when ready, or split into separate pages later if the catalog and SEO goals justify it.
