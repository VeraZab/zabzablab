                If you are drawn to deep greens, you are in good company. This vignette was sparked by
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNGZPC2xXUI/"> a recent post</a> showing how moody color palettes can
                actually help buyers connect with a space. In kitchens especially, olive tones feel grounded and
                timeless.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, it is hard to decorate purely for yourself without hearing that little voice about 
                <em>resale value</em>. The nice part is you do not have to choose one or the other. Research from Zillow
                and Sherwin‑Williams notes that richer hues can correlate with stronger sale prices—olive in the kitchen,
                navy in the bedroom, and charcoal in the living room—so your love of deep green can be both personal and
                practical.
            </p>

                If you want a simple, budget‑friendly way to bring that color in, try pattern. My
                <a href="https://www.spoonflower.com/collections/1388283-jewel-tone-mediterranean-tile-by-zabzablab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Jewel Tone Mediterranean Tile </a>
                collection layers deep, dark greens in a way that plays nicely with wood tones, stone, and warm metals—no
                heavy remodel required.
            </p>
            <p>
                And yes, wallpaper in a kitchen is absolutely a thing. Use it on a breakfast‑nook wall, the island back
                panel, above a wainscot, inside glass‑front cabinets, or even on the ceiling for a quiet wow‑moment. Kept
                away from direct water and high heat, quality wallpaper holds up well; a clear, wipeable topcoat adds an
                extra layer of peace of mind.

            <h2>Choose Non‑Pasted Traditional Wallpaper for Kitchens</h2>
            <p>
                Non‑pasted wallpaper comes without adhesive; you apply paste to the wall or the paper
                during install. It is a touch more process than peel‑and‑stick, but it rewards you with a durable,
                long‑lasting finish—one reason it is common in commercial spaces, bathrooms, and kitchens.
            </p>

                My favorite way to start is with samples. Tape a few swatches around the room and live with them through
                the day—morning light, evening light, task lighting—to confirm both color and scale before you commit.
