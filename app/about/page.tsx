                Hi! I'm Vera. I started playing around with my iPad a few years
                ago when I became a mom, and just never stopped. I love creating
                patterns for interiors, it's a true passion of mine. Lately, the
                grandmillennial style is calling to me so here you'll find some
                of the latest that I've been working on.
