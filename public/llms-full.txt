## Faux Texture Wallpaper Collections

### Faux Fabric Textures
Realistic faux fabric texture wallpaper and fabric — a neutral, tactile base that plays well with bold art, vintage finds, or a quiet palette without competing for attention. Every texture starts from a real, high-resolution photograph of actual fabric.

Available textures:
- **Tight Linen Weave** — [Shop on Spoonflower](https://www.spoonflower.com/collections/1459860-tight-linen-weave-zab26005-by-zabzablab)
- **Slubby Vertical Grasscloth** — [Shop on Spoonflower](https://www.spoonflower.com/en/collections/1341765)
- **Soft Basketweave** — [Shop on Spoonflower](https://www.spoonflower.com/en/collections/1341765)
- **Slubby Linen** — [Shop on Spoonflower](https://www.spoonflower.com/collections/1462110)

Benefits compared to real textile wallcovering:
- Available on wallpaper and fabric, color customizable
- Easy to clean and maintain compared to real fabric on walls
- Fraction of the cost of real grasscloth or textile wallcovering
- Quick turnaround

### Faux Stone Textures
Organic, tactile stone textures for feature walls, accents, or full rooms. They read as natural material without the cost or weight of real stone — easy to customize to your palette and scale.

### Faux Limewash Textures
Soft, plaster-like depth with the look of limewash or mineral paint — without the mess. Ideal for calm, European-inspired walls and spaces that want texture without going bold.

All faux textures can be color customized, adjusted to scale, or rotated.

### Why Dark Green Kitchens Attract Buyers
*Published: August 24, 2025*

Insights inspired by Zillow and Sherwin-Williams research on color and home value. Deep olive green in kitchens correlates with stronger sale prices and buyer appeal. Key points:

- Dark green tones (olive, forest) in kitchens feel grounded and timeless
- Zillow and Sherwin-Williams research shows richer hues correlate with stronger sale prices — olive in the kitchen, navy in the bedroom, charcoal in the living room
- Wallpaper is a budget-friendly way to bring color into a kitchen (breakfast nooks, island back panels, above wainscoting, inside glass-front cabinets, ceilings)
- Non-pasted traditional wallpaper is recommended for kitchens for durability
- ZabZabLab offers custom color matching to any paint code
